> 'npx' is not recognized as an internal or external command,> 
> operable program or batch file.> 
> 

#### _Assistant_

> The command failed to execute because `npx` is not recognized. This indicates that `npm` might not be installed or configured correctly in the environment where the command is being run.  To resolve this, you need to install Node.js and npm.  After installing Node.js and npm, the command should run successfully.
